Pi Day 2024

This is a program to calculate the value of pi on a Raspberry Pi using the Spigot Method.

The program depends on the pigpio library, included with the Raspbian OS by default.

The digits of pi are output on a 4-digit, 7-segment LED clock display, controlled by the Raspberry P GPIO pins. The Raspberry Pi drives the clock display itself and no additional hardware is used.
